      <h3>About Trieu</h3>

      <p>After graduating college, I became a banker and worked with diversified groups of clients from many different backgrounds. I found myself enjoy collaborating with my team to solve clients' problems and that made me interested in becoming a programmer.</p>

      <p>As a retail stock investor, I learned trading global equity markets, currencies, and options. I’ve also gained the knowledge of corporate fundamentals and parameters of the companies that I want to invest/trade. From the period of March – June 2020, I was able the increase my account by more than 460% by investing in pharmaceutical companies using the research skills and the ability to calculate risk & returns of the investments.</p>

      <p>As a student at <!-- Link to Thinkful website --> <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software engineer and developed a new habit of coding for 5-6 hours every day. I can't wait to see what skills I will acquire after I graduated from the program.</p>
